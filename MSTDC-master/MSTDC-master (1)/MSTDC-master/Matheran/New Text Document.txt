Nestled amidst the Sahyadri range on the Western Ghats, Matheran is a cosy little hill station that stands at an elevation of 2600 feet above sea level, and is just 100 kilometres away from Mumbai, making it the perfect weekend getaway. With its name literally translating to “overhead forest”, Matheran is the smallest hill station in all of India, but it is extremely popular in terms of tourists looking for a short trip amid spectacular vistas and serenity.
