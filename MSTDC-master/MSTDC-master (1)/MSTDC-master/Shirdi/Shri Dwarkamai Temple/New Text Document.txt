Shri Dwarkamai Temple is located in Shirdi. Shri Sai Baba came to Shirdi with a marriage procession. Lord Sai baba stayed at Dwarkamai until the very stop of his lifestyles. Dwarkamai is situated on the right of the doorway of Samadhi Mandir. Here god Sai Baba solved troubles of the people, cured their sickness and worries. Before Baba's arrival in Shridhi, Dwarkamai was an vintage mosque in a dilapidated circumstance. Baba became it into Dwarkamai and proved that God is one.
 
The first stage of Dwarkamai has a portrait of Baba and a big stone on which Baba used to sit down. This degree has  rooms. One carries the chariot and the second one a palkhi. Just in front of the room wherein the chariot is saved is a small temple. A saffron flag flies over it. The 2nd  stage of Dwarkamai has a rectangular stool fabricated from stone, which Baba used for taking a bathtub. The predominant appeal of this area is the oil painting of Shri Sai Baba sitting in a carved wood shrine. This stage also has the grinding stone and the wood vessel referred to as Kolamba in which Baba used to keep the Bhiksha delivered from the village.
