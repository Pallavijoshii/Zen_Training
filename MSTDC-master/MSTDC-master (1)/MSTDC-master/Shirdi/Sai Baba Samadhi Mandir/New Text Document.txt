Shirdi, a small rural town in the Rahata taluka of Ahmednagar district in the Maharashtra state of India. Shirdi is a secular place where all religions are treated as one & a belief in the power of Faith & Patience is foremost. A place where all heads bow down in prayer, where faith prevails, where hopes are built, where patience pays, and where infinite joy and everlasting contentment abound. Such is the glory of the place which belongs to the Holy Saint, a true repository of wisdom, who pleased all with pious equality and gifted mankind ornaments of humanity and peace by saying "SABKA MALIK EK". The footprints of Saibaba have made this town a holy place. Millions of devotees continuously flock here from all over India and abroad. Situated on the Ahmednagar-Manmad highway.
