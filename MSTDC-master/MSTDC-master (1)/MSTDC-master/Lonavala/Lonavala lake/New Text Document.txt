At the outskirts of Lonavala, and sourced by Inrayani River, Lonavala Lake mesmerizes the visitors with simplistic beauty and serene nature around. The lake is popularly known as the monsoon lake, because it gets filled with water during monsoon and dries up during winter season. The place is the best tourist attraction in Lonavala especially during monsoon, when the birds of different species and fauna can be spotted on the fringes of this charming lake. The beautiful weather is complemented with the handy food items like Mumbai’s vada pav, smoked corn, shaved gola, chaat with hot ginger tea. Other than bird watching there are other activities also that the visitors can indulge into like swimming, angling and nature walk.
