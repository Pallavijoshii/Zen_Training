The Nasik Caves, or sometimes Pandavleni Caves (or Pandu Lena,[1] Pandu Caves or Trirashmi Leni, Trirashmi being the name of the hills in which the caves are located, Leni being a Marathi word for caves), are a group of 24 caves carved between the 1st century BCE and the 3nd century CE, though additional sculptures were added up to about the 6th century, reflecting changes in Buddhist devotional practices.[2] They are a significant group of early examples of Indian rock-cut architecture initially representing the Hinayana tradition. Most of the caves are viharas except for Cave 18 which is a chaitya of the 1st century BCE.[3] The style of some of the elaborate pillars or columns, for example in caves 3 and 10, is an important example of the development of the form [4]. The location of the caves is a holy Buddhist site and is located about 8 km south of the center of Nashik (or Nasik), Maharashtra, India, as well as some of the inscriptions of cave 3 and 10 contain one of the earliest known Sanskrit inscriptions about charities towards Hindu Brahmanas at the Prabhasa [5].

Their name has nothing to do with the characters Pandavas, characters in the Mahabharata epic. Other caves in the area are Karla Caves, Bhaja Caves, Patan Buddhist Cave and Bedse Caves.

These caves are one of the oldest caves of Maharashtra. Some of the caves are large and contain numerous chambers - these rock-cut caves served as a viharas or monasteries for the disciples to meet and hear sermons. They contain interesting sculptures. One of the vihara caves is older and finer in sculptural detail and is thought to be nearly as old as the Karla Cave near Lonavala. Another cave (cave No. 18) is a chaitya and is similar in age to that at the Karla Caves and has a particularly elaborate facade. Chaityas are used for chanting and meditation.

The cave has images of Buddha, Bodhisattva, sculptures representing the King, farmers, merchants and rich iconography depicting a beautiful amalgamation of Indo - Greek architecture[10][11]

The site has an excellent ancient water management system and skillfully chiseled out of solid rock are several attractive water tanks.
