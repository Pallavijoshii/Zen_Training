At a distance of 3 km from Satara Bus Station, Natraj Mandir, also known as Uttara Chidambaram Temple, is a popular temple situated in Maharashtra and is located off NH4, connecting Satara and Solapur. It is one of the top places to visit in Satara.

The Natraj Mandir is dedicated to Lord Natraj, a manifestation of Lord Shiva performing the Tandava dance. The foundation for the temple was laid on May 1981. Samanna, a resident of Satara gifted the land for building the temple. The funding was given by the state governments of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu while the timber needed for the entire construction of the temple was given by the government of Kerala.

It is a replica of Sri Natraj Temple at Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu, in much smaller size and is a desire of Sri Chandra Shekharendra Swami. Sri Uttara Chidambaram Temple was built by the famous sculpture artist Mr. M.S. Ganapathi Sthapathi and his brother Mr. M. Mutthayya Sthapathi. Similar to the Chidambaram Temple in Tamil Nadu, the Natraj Mandir also has four large entrances on four sides.

In addition to the main temple of Lord Natraj, other shrines located in the temple complex are Ganapathi Mandir, Hanuman Mandir, Radha-Krishna Mandir, Shivlinga Mandir, Navgraha Mandir, Adi Shankaracharya Mandir and Ayyappa Swami Mandir.

The temple is under the management of Kanchi Shankara Mutt. It attracts lakhs of devotees and pilgrims to pay worship to Lord Sri Natraj. A Veda Paatasala is also being run by Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam near the temple. The temple committee organizes various cultural & spiritual programs and is a famous platform for the classical dance performers.
